# GettingCleaningData_project
Project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## What is contained in the GettingCleaningData_project repository?
* UCI HAR Dataset: This directory contains all the raw data files, as downloaded from the course project page. Within the UCI HAR Dataset directory a README and other documents describing the features and labels, as well as two necessary folders called "train" and "test".
    - "train" contains X_train.txt, y_train.txt, and subject_train.txt, the training dataset.
    - "test" contains X_test.txt, y_test.txt, and subject_test.txt, the testing dataset.
    
* run_analysis.R: The R script used to read in the raw data from UCI HAR Dataset, and process into a tidy dataset. A description of what this script does and what the resulting tidy dataset is will follow later in this document.

* tidy_data.txt: The resulting tidy dataset as output from run_analysis.R.

* Codebook.md: The codebook for the resulting tidy dataset.

* README.md: The readme for this project (this document).

## How does the run_analysis.R script work?
